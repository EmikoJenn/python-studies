# My personal projects folder (for Python)
studies, activities and more trash I made while I learn

## How to navigate
- I'll make a README.md for each project (eventually)
- Whenever I lose interest in one of them I'll send them to the gulag ("Droped" folder)

## Rules
- you're alowed to pull, use, modify and deploy any of my proyects, just don't blame me if they break and warn me if I left my private keys and info in them by accident
- Also my code doesn't have lisense of any kind, I don't know how to make them free of copyright, yet...

### Motive for this repo
I've made a lot of code while I studied by myself, all of it got lost or I deleted it because I didn't know it would be evidence of how much I've studied, now I work as a software developer and wanna keep all my code safe, to show how much I know and to remember whenever I forget how to do stuff, also I wanna be able to change OS without worring to losing my code
